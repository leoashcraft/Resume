## About The Project

[![Resume Screenshot][resume-screenshot]][resume-screenshot-url]

Transforming a mundane PDF/DOCX resume into an engaging and dynamic online portfolio was not just a task—it was an exciting journey into the world of web development. This project served as a perfect playground to experiment with CSS's visual capabilities and React's component-based architecture, bringing to life a resume that not only communicates skills and experience but does so with flair and creativity.

In the quest for a modern development experience, I ventured into using Vite, a build tool that promises a faster and leaner development setup. Vite's hot module replacement and out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more, significantly enhanced the development workflow, making the process as smooth as it was efficient.

A key focus was on ensuring the portfolio's performance and visual appeal, which led to the decision to craft all graphics (barring the personal selfie) using CSS and SVG. This approach not only kept the visual elements sharp and scalable across different devices but also significantly reduced the website's load time, ensuring that visitors could access the content quickly and smoothly.

However, the journey to optimize the online resume doesn't stop here. The next milestones include mastering GZIP compression to further reduce file sizes and improve load times, enhancing the first contentful paint to ensure that visitors are greeted with immediate visual content, and mitigating cumulative layout shift by strategically using placeholders. These technical endeavors aim to refine the user experience, making every visit to the portfolio not just informative but also pleasantly seamless.

### Built With

## About Me

Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex

Software Engineer @ SFG | Full Stack Web Development + Data Science

As a PHP Software Developer at Strategic Fulfillment Group (SFG), I lead a team in developing a multi-tenant data analytics monolithic application with a tech stack consisting of PHP 7.4, SQL, JavaScript, and jQuery. We provide fulfillment services for high-profile clientele including The Smithsonian Institution, Mayo Clinic, D Magazine, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Arizona Highways, The New York Review of Books, among others. Products include subscription boxes, magazines, and books.

In my role, I adhere to best practices consistent with PCI compliance and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) standards. I'm actively involved in every stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC), encompassing coding standards, reviews, source control management, builds, testing, and operations. Moreover, I'm responsible for implementing APIs, crafting landing pages, and orchestrating the processing of payments through specific Merchant IDs (MIDs), all aimed at ensuring a smooth and efficient transactional flow.

My foray into software development began at the age of 14, marking the start of a lifelong engagement with technology. A project particularly dear to me, sprouted from a father-son hobby. This endeavor, RadioDaddy.com, which we started using phpBB, burgeoned into the web’s largest voiceover exchange platform for years to come. It not only transformed a personal project into a distinctive online community but also connected voices from across the globe, eventually culminating into a network of over 50,000 members. Radio Daddy was acquired by one of it's own esteemed members.

I believe in lifelong learning and am dedicated to continuously sharpening my skills through self-study, participation in the developer community, and further education. In 2021, I graduated from Coding Temple's 14-Week Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, committing over four hours each evening to assignments, whiteboard algorithm practice, and live lectures. This intensive program enhanced my proficiency in PHP, JavaScript frameworks like React and Next.js, SQL, Python, Git, HTML, and CSS. In 2022, I enrolled in Coding Temple's 6-month Data Analysis bootcamp, expanding my expertise in Python, SQL, MongoDB, among other technologies. Most recently, in 2023, I earned a Meta Front-End Developer Certification, deepening my React skills and UI/UX design knowledge.

In addition to my technical expertise, my resume highlights my extensive managerial experience which I believe would be of particular value. As a Director of Operations and Director of IT Operations at previous organizations, I managed teams of up to 30 individuals, orchestrating development projects, streamlining processes, and significantly enhancing operational efficiency. My leadership contributed to a notable increase in engagement and a reduction in administrative workloads, proving my ability to lead and innovate in high-stakes environments.
