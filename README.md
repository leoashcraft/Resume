## About The Project

[![Resume Screenshot][resume-screenshot]][resume-screenshot-url]

Transforming a mundane PDF/DOCX resume into an engaging and dynamic online portfolio was not just a taskâ€”it was an exciting journey into the world of web development. This project served as a perfect playground to experiment with CSS's visual capabilities and React's component-based architecture, bringing to life a resume that not only communicates skills and experience but does so with flair and creativity.

In the quest for a modern development experience, I ventured into using Vite, a build tool that promises a faster and leaner development setup. Vite's hot module replacement and out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more, significantly enhanced the development workflow, making the process as smooth as it was efficient.

A key focus was on ensuring the portfolio's performance and visual appeal, which led to the decision to craft all graphics (barring the personal selfie) using CSS and SVG. This approach not only kept the visual elements sharp and scalable across different devices but also significantly reduced the website's load time, ensuring that visitors could access the content quickly and smoothly.

However, the journey to optimize the online resume doesn't stop here. The next milestones include mastering GZIP compression to further reduce file sizes and improve load times, enhancing the first contentful paint to ensure that visitors are greeted with immediate visual content, and mitigating cumulative layout shift by strategically using placeholders. These technical endeavors aim to refine the user experience, making every visit to the portfolio not just informative but also pleasantly seamless.

### Built With
